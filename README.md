ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! My name is Ziniu WU. I am a PhD student in Robotics at the University of Bristol (UoB) and affiliated with the Bristol Robotics Laboratory (BRL). I am supervised by Dr. Bahadir Kocer and Prof. Arthur Richards. My research focuses on Continual Learning for Dynamical Systems to enhance their adaptation and robustness in unconstructed and dynamic environments.
